========================================================================
Simple stuff.

To use, run python interactively. Then

>>> execfile("sdr1k-setup.py")

to get the interface started.

To set the frequency, do 

>>> setDDSFreq(14.077)

To toggle the mute relay,

>>> setMuteRelay(not getMuteRelay())

etc.

To shut down,

>>> closeRig()

and exit python. (The startup script, which is crude and will be
replaced shortly, does an openRig("/dev/parport0")
========================================================================

To build:

There is a simple Makefile that does just the following --

swig -python hardware.i
gcc -fPIC -I. -I/usr/include/python -c hardware_wrap.c
gcc -fPIC -I. -c hardware.c
ld -shared hardware.o hardware_wrap.o -o _sdr1khw.so

Ready to go.
